## Overview

This is a simple e-commerce product listing application that allows users to view, search, and manage products. The application is built with a Vue.js frontend and a Node.js backend using Express. It includes user authentication, CRUD operations for product management, and responsive design.

## Features

### Frontend (Vue.js)
- **Product Listing Page**: Displays products with details such as name, description, price, and image.
- **Add New Product**: Authenticated users can add new products via a form.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can filter products by name using a search bar.
- **User Authentication**: Users can log in via a form to access protected features.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be compatible across different devices.

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **Product Management API**: Supports CRUD operations for products.
- **User Authentication API**: Provides login functionality with JWT authentication.
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware is used to protect routes, allowing only authenticated users to add, update, or delete products.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL for storing user and product data.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Vue Router, Vuex, CSS (Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS/Custom)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, JWT for authentication
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose or SQL database with Sequelize
